# Borrower Default Prediction for P2P Lending Company  

## Project Overview  
This project predicts borrower default risk for a peer-to-peer lending platform (LendingClub) using historical loan and borrower data. The goal is to build predictive models that identify high-risk borrowers and improve credit decision-making.  

---

## 🔧 Workflow  
1. **Environment Setup & Data Import**  
  - Imported loan dataset, set up Python libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn).  

2. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
  - Inspected dataset structure, handled missing values, optimized data types.  
  - Engineered features from borrower demographics, income, and loan attributes.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Visualized distributions, correlations, and patterns.  
  - Identified key factors influencing loan status.  

4. **Modeling & Evaluation**  
  - Implemented **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other classifiers**.  
  - Evaluated performance using **accuracy, ROC-AUC, and feature importance**.  
  - Achieved **accuracy >0.80** in predicting loan default.

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Borrower **income** and borrowing **cost (interest rate)** are the most critical predictors of default, while debt level and credit history further adjust the risk assessment.
- **Credit history length** and **revolving utilization rate** are additional key predictors.  
- Predictive modeling provides **actionable insights** to reduce credit risk exposure.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Techniques**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Feature Engineering, ROC-AUC Evaluation

## 🎯 Outcome  
This project demonstrates the application of **machine learning in credit risk prediction**, helping lenders identify risky borrowers and make data-driven lending decisions.
